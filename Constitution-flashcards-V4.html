const CARDS = [
  /* ===================== Foundations (1–15) ===================== */
  { q: "What taxation flaw doomed the Articles of Confederation?",
    a: "Congress had no power to levy taxes; it could only request money from the states.",
    exp: "Without an independent revenue stream the national government could not pay debts, fund defense, or run basic operations, which exposed the system's weakness and pushed leaders toward a new constitution." },
  { q: "Why did the Articles’ lack of an executive branch matter?",
    a: "There was no national officer to enforce laws or lead during crises.",
    exp: "Even when Congress made decisions, states could ignore them because no single executive had authority to implement or coordinate action across the union." },
  { q: "What problem flowed from the Articles’ lack of a national judiciary?",
    a: "There was no uniform court system to resolve disputes among states or interpret national laws.",
    exp: "Conflicting state rulings and unanswered questions about interstate issues made the union unstable and undermined the rule of law across state lines." },
  { q: "Why did large states resist the Articles’ one‑state, one‑vote rule?",
    a: "Representation ignored population size, giving small states equal power in Congress.",
    exp: "Citizens in bigger states had proportionally less influence, which felt undemocratic and fueled calls for representation that reflected the people as well as the states." },
  { q: "Why were amendments under the Articles nearly impossible to pass?",
    a: "They required unanimous approval by all thirteen states.",
    exp: "Any single state could veto needed reforms, freezing the system even when most agreed change was necessary." },
  { q: "What defense weakness did the Articles create?",
    a: "The national government lacked a reliable standing military force.",
    exp: "With no assured funding or command structure, the union was slow and inconsistent in responding to threats or rebellions." },
  { q: "What did Shays’ Rebellion reveal about the Articles of Confederation?",
    a: "It exposed the national government’s inability to maintain order and support state stability.",
    exp: "Massachusetts struggled to respond to the uprising, highlighting the need for a stronger central government that could help preserve domestic tranquility." },
  { q: "Who were two leading Federalists, and what did they argue?",
    a: "James Madison and Alexander Hamilton argued for a stronger national government constrained by structural checks.",
    exp: "They believed that careful design—separation of powers, checks and balances, and federalism—could create energy in government without inviting tyranny." },
  { q: "Who were two notable Anti‑Federalists, and what did they demand?",
    a: "Patrick Henry and George Mason demanded explicit protections for individual rights.",
    exp: "They feared consolidated power and insisted that a bill of rights be added so basic liberties would be beyond government reach." },
  { q: "According to Federalists, what solved the problem of disorder in the states?",
    a: "A stronger national government balanced by checks and balances would provide stability without sacrificing liberty.",
    exp: "Institutional design—not mere trust in leaders—was Madison’s answer to faction and conflict." },
  { q: "What did Anti‑Federalists insist on to safeguard liberty?",
    a: "They insisted on a Bill of Rights as a condition for broad support of the Constitution.",
    exp: "Clear, textual guarantees for speech, religion, due process, and more would reassure citizens that the new government had limits." },
  { q: "What is the core claim of Federalist No. 10?",
    a: "A large republic is the best way to control factions and protect minority rights.",
    exp: "With many diverse interests, it becomes harder for any single faction to dominate, which protects liberty better than small, uniform polities." },
  { q: "What is the core claim of Federalist No. 51?",
    a: "Separation of powers and checks and balances allow ambition to counteract ambition.",
    exp: "Because each branch has motives to defend its turf, no branch can easily accumulate all power, keeping government limited and accountable." },
  { q: "What did Brutus No. 1 fear about federal power under the new Constitution?",
    a: "That the Necessary and Proper Clause and the Supremacy Clause would overpower the states.",
    exp: "Brutus warned that broad federal means and legal supremacy could gradually erase meaningful state authority and local self‑government." },
  { q: "Why did Brutus argue that a large republic would be impractical?",
    a: "Representatives would be too distant from the people to understand and reflect local interests.",
    exp: "He believed only small republics can keep officials close to citizens and responsive to their needs." },

  /* ===================== Articles I–VII (16–40) ===================== */
  { q: "What does Article I establish?",
    a: "Article I creates the legislative branch—a bicameral Congress composed of the House and the Senate.",
    exp: "The House represents the people by population with short two‑year terms; the Senate represents states equally with six‑year terms to promote stability." },
  { q: "What unique role does the House of Representatives have in lawmaking?",
    a: "All revenue (tax) bills must originate in the House.",
    exp: "Because House members are closest to the voters, the Constitution gives them the first word on raising public money." },
  { q: "Name two distinctive roles of the Senate.",
    a: "The Senate ratifies treaties and confirms major executive and judicial appointments.",
    exp: "The Senate also tries impeachments; when the president is tried, the Chief Justice presides to reinforce impartiality." },
  { q: "Give three important enumerated powers of Congress.",
    a: "Congress can levy taxes, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and declare war.",
    exp: "Other listed powers include coining money, establishing federal courts, raising and supporting armies, and maintaining a navy." },
  { q: "What does the Necessary and Proper (Elastic) Clause authorize?",
    a: "It allows Congress to pass laws needed to carry out its enumerated powers.",
    exp: "This clause creates implied powers—flexibility to choose reasonable means to achieve constitutionally assigned ends." },
  { q: "What does the Commerce Clause empower Congress to do?",
    a: "It authorizes Congress to regulate trade among the states and with foreign nations.",
    exp: "Over time it became a central basis for federal economic policy and many civil‑rights protections affecting interstate activities." },
  { q: "Give two limits Article I places on Congress.",
    a: "Congress may not pass bills of attainder or ex post facto laws.",
    exp: "Other limits include no taxes on exports, no titles of nobility, protection of habeas corpus except in emergencies, and spending only by appropriation." },
  { q: "How is impeachment divided between the House and the Senate?",
    a: "The House impeaches (brings charges); the Senate conducts the trial and may convict and remove.",
    exp: "For presidential trials the Chief Justice presides; conviction requires a two‑thirds Senate vote, underscoring its seriousness." },
  { q: "What does Article II establish?",
    a: "Article II establishes the executive branch headed by the President of the United States.",
    exp: "The President executes the laws, serves as Commander in Chief, negotiates treaties, and appoints key officials—subject to checks by the other branches." },
  { q: "Name three core presidential powers in Article II.",
    a: "Serving as Commander in Chief, appointing officers and judges (with Senate consent), and negotiating treaties (subject to Senate ratification).",
    exp: "These powers give the executive energy in foreign affairs and administration while the Senate’s role provides democratic oversight." },
  { q: "What is the Take Care Clause in Article II?",
    a: "It requires the President to ‘take care that the laws be faithfully executed.’",
    exp: "This clause grounds executive enforcement authority and limits broad non‑enforcement; the President must implement duly enacted laws." },
  { q: "How are presidential powers checked by the other branches?",
    a: "The Senate must confirm many appointments and ratify treaties, Congress can override vetoes, and both branches share impeachment powers.",
    exp: "These checks ensure cooperation across branches and prevent unilateral executive control." },
  { q: "What is the impeachment standard for civil officers in Article II?",
    a: "Officers may be impeached and removed for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.",
    exp: "The phrase captures serious abuses of public trust, leaving room for Congress to judge misconduct that threatens constitutional governance." },
  { q: "What does Article III establish?",
    a: "Article III creates the judicial branch and vests the judicial power in one Supreme Court and any inferior courts Congress creates.",
    exp: "It outlines jurisdiction and protects judicial independence so courts can interpret the law without political pressure." },
  { q: "How does Article III protect judicial independence?",
    a: "Federal judges hold office during good behavior and cannot have their salaries reduced while in office.",
    exp: "Security of tenure and pay helps judges decide cases based on law rather than politics or fear of retaliation." },
  { q: "How does the Constitution define treason against the United States?",
    a: "Treason consists only of levying war against the U.S. or adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort.",
    exp: "A conviction requires either a confession in open court or testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, setting a high bar to protect dissent." },
  { q: "What does the Full Faith and Credit Clause require of states?",
    a: "States must recognize the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of other states.",
    exp: "This rule promotes legal continuity so judgments, adoptions, and other civil acts remain valid when people move across state lines." },
  { q: "What is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV?",
    a: "States may not discriminate against citizens of other states in fundamental matters like earning a livelihood.",
    exp: "It helps maintain national unity by protecting core civil and economic rights for visitors and new residents." },
  { q: "What does Article IV say about extradition?",
    a: "A person charged with a crime who flees to another state must be returned to the state with jurisdiction on request.",
    exp: "Extradition prevents defendants from evading justice simply by crossing state borders." },
  { q: "How are new states admitted under Article IV?",
    a: "Congress admits new states, and a new state cannot be formed within an existing one without consent of the state legislature and Congress.",
    exp: "This process balances national growth with respect for existing state boundaries and consent." },
  { q: "What does the Guarantee Clause promise to every state?",
    a: "The United States shall guarantee to every state a republican form of government and protection against invasion and, on request, domestic violence.",
    exp: "The clause commits the nation to representative government in the states and to mutual security in emergencies." },
  { q: "What does Article V outline?",
    a: "Article V provides the process to amend the Constitution.",
    exp: "Amendments are proposed by two‑thirds of Congress or a convention called by two‑thirds of the states and are ratified by three‑fourths of the states." },
  { q: "What does the Supremacy Clause in Article VI declare?",
    a: "The Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties are the supreme law of the land.",
    exp: "When valid federal law conflicts with state law, federal law prevails within its constitutional sphere." },
  { q: "What oaths or tests does Article VI address?",
    a: "All federal and state officers must swear to support the Constitution, and no religious test may ever be required for office.",
    exp: "The oath binds officials to the constitutional system, while the ban on religious tests protects freedom of conscience." },
  { q: "What does Article VII do?",
    a: "Article VII sets the ratification process for the Constitution, providing that it would take effect after approval by nine states.",
    exp: "This clause allowed the new frame of government to begin functioning without unanimity, avoiding the Articles’ paralysis." },

  /* ===================== Key Principles (41–55) ===================== */
  { q: "What is popular sovereignty?",
    a: "Popular sovereignty means that all governmental power ultimately comes from the people.",
    exp: "The Constitution opens with ‘We the People,’ signaling that authority is delegated upward from citizens, not granted downward by rulers." },
  { q: "What is republicanism?",
    a: "Republicanism is rule through elected representatives who are accountable to the voters.",
    exp: "This design balances responsiveness with stability, filtering public views through deliberation rather than instant, direct votes on every issue." },
  { q: "What is meant by limited government and the rule of law?",
    a: "Government officials are bound by the Constitution and laws; their powers are granted and constrained.",
    exp: "No one is above the law, and officials may act only where the Constitution authorizes, protecting liberty from arbitrary power." },
  { q: "What is separation of powers?",
    a: "Separation of powers divides governmental functions among legislative, executive, and judicial branches.",
    exp: "Each branch specializes and has distinct tools, making it harder for power to concentrate in any one set of hands." },
  { q: "What are checks and balances?",
    a: "Checks and balances are mechanisms by which each branch can restrain the others.",
    exp: "Examples include the presidential veto and congressional override, the Senate’s confirmation power, judicial review, and impeachment." },
  { q: "What is judicial review?",
    a: "Judicial review is the power of the courts to invalidate laws or executive actions that violate the Constitution.",
    exp: "Established in Marbury v. Madison, it ensures that the Constitution remains the supreme rule that binds all branches." },
  { q: "What is federalism?",
    a: "Federalism divides power between a national government and the states.",
    exp: "The national government handles truly national problems, while states retain authority over local matters, allowing diversity with unity." },
  { q: "How do enumerated powers differ from implied powers?",
    a: "Enumerated powers are explicitly listed; implied powers are reasonably inferred from the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
    exp: "Implied powers let Congress choose effective means—like creating a bank—to carry out its listed ends, such as taxing and spending." },
  { q: "What are concurrent powers?",
    a: "Concurrent powers are powers shared by both the federal government and the states.",
    exp: "Typical examples include taxing, operating courts, and enforcing laws, areas where cooperation is routine." },
  { q: "What are reserved powers?",
    a: "Reserved powers are those not delegated to the federal government and kept by the states or the people, as the Tenth Amendment states.",
    exp: "They include core ‘police powers’ like public health, safety, education, and running elections—functions closest to daily life." },
  { q: "Why did the Framers make the amendment process difficult?",
    a: "They required supermajorities to ensure stability while still allowing genuine consensus to change the charter.",
    exp: "Hard—but not impossible—rules prevent frequent, faction‑driven rewrites and protect minority rights from sudden swings." },
  { q: "What is selective incorporation?",
    a: "Selective incorporation applies most of the Bill of Rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.",
    exp: "Case by case, the Supreme Court recognized rights as fundamental and therefore binding on state and local governments, not just the federal government." },
  { q: "Which case cemented judicial review at the federal level?",
    a: "Marbury v. Madison established that the Supreme Court can strike down unconstitutional laws.",
    exp: "The decision positioned the Court as the final interpreter of the Constitution, preventing Congress or the President from being judges in their own causes." },
  { q: "Give an example of an executive check on the legislature.",
    a: "The President can veto bills passed by Congress.",
    exp: "The veto forces Congress to reconsider and build a two‑thirds supermajority if it wants to enact the law anyway." },
  { q: "Give an example of a legislative check on the executive.",
    a: "The Senate must confirm many presidential nominees and may refuse to ratify treaties.",
    exp: "Congress also controls appropriations and may impeach and remove executive officers when necessary." },

  /* ========== Bill of Rights & Civil Liberties (56–80) ========== */
